## The Date is: `r Sys.Date()`

## Overview

In this assignment, I created a web page showing th location of the famous landmark of my neighborhood called "Hanioporta" or " Pantokrator Bastion". The webpage contains the date I created the document and the map created with Leaflet.

```{r, echo = TRUE, cashe = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)

hanioporta <- leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=35.336996,lng=25.124863,popup='Pantokrator Bastion "Hanioporta"')
hanioporta

```
